# 📖 NLP Project on SDoH Label Extraction

## 🌟 Project Overview

This project aims to evaluate and compare the effectiveness of various language models (including GPT-2, GPT-3.5 Turbo, GPT-4 Turbo, and Gemma 7B) in identifying Social Determinants of Health (SDoH) from electronic health records (EHR). The project involves fine-tuning a GPT-2 model on a specialized SDoH dataset, augmenting data with GPT-3.5, and performing inference using multiple state-of-the-art models.

## 🛠️ Methodology

### Data Preparation and Augmentation
- **Dataset Files:** Contain the original and augmented datasets.
- **augument_data.ipynb:** Jupyter notebook used to augment the MTS dataset with SDoH information using GPT-3.5.

### Model Fine-Tuning and Inference
- **gpt2_finetune:** Contains notebooks and scripts for training the GPT-2 model on SDoH data.
- **gpt3.5_turbo, gpt4-turbo, gemma:** Directories containing scripts to perform inference on both the SDoH test set and the augmented MTS dataset, utilizing the respective model's API.

## 📊 Results

The fine-tuned GPT-2 model demonstrated excellent performance with the following accuracies on the SHADR test set:
- **SDoH Label Accuracy:** 85.56%
- **Adverse Label Accuracy:** 91.11%

On the augmented MTS dataset, the model performances were:
- **SDoH Label Accuracy:** 69.59%
- **Adverse Label Accuracy:** 61.8%

The results illustrate the potential of advanced NLP models in enhancing the extraction of SDoH information from clinical narratives, which is pivotal for improving healthcare outcomes and equity.

## 🚀 Usage
